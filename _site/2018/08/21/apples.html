  <p>An apple is a sweet, edible fruit produced by an apple tree.</p>

<p>Apple trees are cultivated worldwide, and are the most widely grown species in
the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor,
Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of
years in Asia and Europe, and were brought to North America by European
colonists.</p>

<p>Apples are the creme de la creme when it comes to fruits. There are quite a few varieties from the granny smith to the ambrosia apple. And the taste is no joke, because when you bite into a fresh juicy apple, youâ€™re about to give your tastebuds a ride. The texture of an apple is crunchy and a bit hard, however the more you eat it the less crunchy is feels. Now that might just be me but frankly the crunch is what makes the apple truly unique. This has been my take on the classic apple.</p>
