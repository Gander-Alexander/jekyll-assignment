Bananas for some reason make my lips hurt?

A banana is an edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several kinds
of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.

In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called "plantains",
distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size, color,
and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in
starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown
when ripe.

The taste of a banana is great, it combines well with sweets like chocolate fondue sauce and nutella. My only issue is that when I eat a banana when I have chapped lips, there is a slight to somewhat painful feeling that I receive and while it does not affect how I eat the banana it just makes the whole experience a little underwhelming. The trick that I learned to combat this is by taking a bite of the banana with only your teeth which lets your lips remain untouched by the banana itself. The other way is to just cut up the banana and eating it with a fork. That's all there is too it, if you enjoyed these facts and my personal take on the banana please feel free to stick around for the next review/ fact blog. Thanks and have a good one.
