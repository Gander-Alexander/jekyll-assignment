I"<p>Kiwifruit (often abbreviated as kiwi), or Chinese gooseberry is the edible
berry of several species of woody vines in the genus Actinidia.</p>

<p>The most common cultivar group of kiwifruit is oval, about the size of a large
hen’s egg (5–8 cm (2.0–3.1 in) in length and 4.5–5.5 cm (1.8–2.2 in) in
diameter). It has a fibrous, dull greenish-brown skin and bright green or
golden flesh with rows of tiny, black, edible seeds. The fruit has a soft
texture, with a sweet and unique flavor.</p>

<p>Kiwis are like the kit kat of fruits, the skin around it is the wrapper and chocolate is the sweet fruit within. I mean sure you can’t break them apart but the comparrison still stands. When referring to the taste of a kiwi you can’t really explain the taste nore the texture. Now while it might be because I’ve only eaten one kiwi in my lifetime but that shouldn’t impact my review. Overall kiwis are an ok fruit with a passable texure. Since I’m the only one who actually gives a score I give it a 5/10. So that was my review.</p>
