I"<p>Tomato’s are by far the worst fruit in the world.</p>

<p>Tomato’s at first were not considered fruits which I was ok with. The history of the tomato is quite rich with some facts being:</p>

<p>The tomato is the edible, often red, berry of the plant Solanum lycopersicum, commonly known as a tomato plant. The species originated in western South America and Central America. The Nahuatl (Aztec language) word tomatl gave rise to the Spanish word tomate, from which the English word tomato derived. Its domestication and use as a cultivated food may have originated with the indigenous peoples of Mexico. The Aztecs used tomatoes in their cooking at the time of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, and after the Spanish encountered the tomato for the first time after their contact with the Aztecs, they brought the plant to Europe. From there, the tomato was introduced to other parts of the European-colonized world during the 16th century.</p>

<p>Tomatoes are a significant source of umami flavor. The tomato is consumed in diverse ways, raw or cooked, in many dishes, sauces, salads, and drinks. While tomatoes are fruits—botanically classified as berries—they are commonly used as a vegetable ingredient or side dish.</p>

<p>However regardless of what they’re used for I just can’t stand them anymore. The biggest thing is the fact that they are now considered fruits all because they seeds. And now I my hatred for tomatos has been solidified by the world of fruits. I used to love the taste of them on a sandwich or even when I dipped french frys in ketchup, but the taste has been sullied for good in my mouth. I will never again trust any food that contains seeds within because at some point they’ll be considered fruits. That was my two cents so have a good one.</p>
