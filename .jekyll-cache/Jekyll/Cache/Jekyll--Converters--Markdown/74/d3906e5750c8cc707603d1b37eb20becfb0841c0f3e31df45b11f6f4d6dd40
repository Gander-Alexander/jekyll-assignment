<p>Created back in 1989 in Seattle, Washington Fruit Blog Co. has been the #1 fruit review company in the world. At first they were merely a two man team consisting of Marco and James who at first made the company as a side gig to show the world about their passion for fruit. And since that fist blog they created it was a massive hit down in 34 states within the USA. During the years of 1990 and 2000 is when they were at their peak.</p>
